This is Kimberly Disher's Lab1. In the top level folder, lab1 are included output files "test_output.txt", 
from the console, "carLab1.ser", a serialized object file. "Automobile.txt" is the input
file to build a car model. The design diagram is Lab1Diagram.jpg.
Java source files Model.java and OptionSet.java are in src/automobile. FileIO.java is src/util.
The driver with main is located at src/tester/driver.java. The driver includes some tests on adding
and deleting options (and a commented out line deleting an option set).
